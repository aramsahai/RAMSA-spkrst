    <li>Problems encountered during inspections and what to do about them
  </ol>
    
      
      
      <pre>
      Here are four of the most common ways that fire sprinkler systems malfunction:

Human Error – One of the top fire sprinkler system problems is human error. Many people believe that these pipes are indestructible, and use them to hang things like ropes and chains or to even help lift heavy objects. This could detrimentally damage the pipes and compromise the fire protection system.
Overheating and Freezing – As fire sprinkler systems are activated by heat, it is important to consider where they will be placed and if overheating could occur. This very common malfunction typically occurs when celling temperatures rise over 150-degrees Fahrenheit. Should this be a concern for your building, especially in the high Florida heat, consider different sprinkler heads that are designed to go off at different temperatures and have a sprinkler system installed that is equipped to handle these conditions. Alternatively, and not as common in Florida, the water in the pipes of a fire sprinkler system has been known to freeze should the necessary precautions not be put in place. Frozen pipes can be prevented with insulation or antifreeze.
Mechanical Damage – Just like everything else in life, fire sprinkler systems require maintenance in order to work properly. Neglecting the system could result in mechanical damage.
Corrosion – Fire sprinkler systems are based on water, which makes corrosion a common problem. It can impact the functionality of the system and lead to leaks, which could cause water damage to your property. Fire inspections should be done to check for any potential leaks and to replace any pipes that are beginning to corrode.

      Failure To Launch
While 91% of sprinklers do activate when they are supposed to, approximately 9% of the time they are ineffective. Why? It’s a combination of things, including a system that has been turned off due to inactivity in the building or a lack of understanding of the platforms. If there’s a water leak throughout the system, the sprinkler system is often turned off. Inexperienced staff members may not realize the business value of a fully workable fire sprinkler system, or perhaps they simply forgot to return the system to working order.

Corrosion
Corrosion or damage to the pipes that send the water where it needs to go can impact the ability of the fire sprinkler system to deliver life-saving water when it is needed the most. The minerals and additives in water have a bad habit of eating away at pipes, causing leaks and a lack of pressure at a dangerous time. Regular maintenance reviews by your professional fire protection partner and rigorous testing are the best ways to ensure that your system is in full working order.

Freezing
Depending on the part of the country where your business resides, freezing can be a big problem for sprinkler systems. They are often piped through industrial areas that may or may not have adequate insulation, leading to a buildup of ice that can expand within the pipes and cause cracks, leaking and lack of pressure. Adding antifreeze to the system helps protect the lines from the dangers associated with extremely low temperatures.

Overheating
Your office staff is unlikely to be thrilled if the air conditioner goes out, and they are suddenly drenched in water on one of the hottest days of the year! When you are defining your fire sprinkler tolerances, be sure to keep in mind the maximum internal temperature that is possible or probable before setting the tolerances of the system.

Poor Installation Or Damage
Poor installation practices and the lack of a structured review process together can make for an inexcusably poor fire sprinkler system. Working with a trusted fire sprinkler service provider gives you the peace of mind that you need to know that you’re fully protected by a system that is up-to-date. This helps protect your investment as well as your staff and customers.

      <pre>
      1. System shutoff

Almost two-thirds (64%) of sprinkler failures occur because the equipment is shut off. This can happen when a building is vacant or under construction or when there are system problems involving leaks or other impairments.

NFPA 25, Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Protection Systems, establishes the minimum requirements for the periodic inspection, testing and maintenance of water-based fire protection systems, and addresses each of the leading causes of sprinkler failures. Closure of control valves is addressed in Chapter 13. An impairment program outlined in Chapter 15 minimizes the length of time a system is out of service, and establishes procedures that ensure systems and valves are properly returned to service upon the completion of all inspection, testing and/or maintenance activities.

 

2. Manual intervention

Manual intervention that defeats a fire sprinkler system accounts for 17% of related failure to operate and represents the second-leading cause of sprinkler failures. Either building staff or firefighters may shut off a system after the fire starts but before sprinklers operated. This may occur when the fire was not immediately visible or was assumed to have been already extinguished. Manual intervention also may occur when some type of obstruction is installed after the sprinkler system has already been installed and the obstruction prevents the fire’s heat from activating the sprinkler system. It also can occur depending on how close the obstruction is to the sprinkler head, where the obstruction can prevent the water from reaching the hazard, or prevent the sprinkler water discharge pattern from developing properly. 

Occupancy type, water supply, closure of valves and change in occupancy or commodity classification that render the installed sprinkler system unsuitable are just a few of the considerations that need to be reviewed before firefighting in a sprinklered building. NFPA 13E, Recommended Practice for Fire Department Operations in Properties Protected by Sprinkler and Standpipe Systems, provides guidance for buildings under construction, inspection and pre-incident planning; fire-ground operations; post-fire operations for properties protected by automatic sprinklers; properties protected by exterior sprinklers for protection against exposure fires; and properties protected by standpipe systems.

 

3. Damaged components

The one mostly nonhuman error for sprinkler system failure is damaged components, which contributes to 7% of sprinkler system failures. Component damage mainly consists of fires where automatic extinguishing equipment was damaged by explosions or by the collapse of a ceiling, roof or entire building. NFPA 13, Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems; NFPA 13D, Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems in One- and Two-Family Dwellings and Manufactured Homes; NFPA 13R, Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems in Low-Rise Residential Occupancies; and NFPA 25 all are written with the assumption the sprinkler system is designed to handle only a single fire at a time. None of these codes accounts for the severity of explosions or the collapse of structural components of the building.

 

4. Lack of maintenance

Six percent of sprinkler failure is due to a lack of maintenance. NFPA 4, Standard for Integrated Fire Protection and Life Safety System Testing, and NFPA 25 provide minimum requirements to confirm systems, if designed to function together, are operating appropriately and maintain the system to ensure proper function.

NFPA 4 provides testing protocols for new or existing integrated fire protection and life-safety systems where such testing is required. An integrated system test confirms that operation, interaction and coordination of multiple individual systems perform their intended function. Many assume these tests are conducted before a certificate of occupancy is issued. Similarly, if a new system is added or a system is modified to existing integrated systems, there’s sometimes the assumption that testing is being performed, which ensures the “handshake” between the systems has been met. This is not true. However, NFPA 4 provides requirements for members on the integrated testing team, writing test plans, developing test scenarios and frequencies, as well as documenting this information for the owner. 

NFPA 25 provides requirements to ensure a reasonable degree of protection for life and property from fire through minimum inspection, testing and maintenance methods for water-based fire protection systems. Known as the “wear and tear” document, NFPA 25 is not intended to evaluate a fire sprinkler system’s design, but rather have the inspector visually inspect the system components.

NFPA 25 categorizes the level of impact for components not meeting the code into three terms: impairment, critical deficiency or noncritical deficiency. Although NFPA 25 does not specify a tagging structure for identifying these levels, many states have developed a series of different color tags to be placed on a system or components to the significance of the condition identified. Impairments include the highest priority problem and should be corrected as soon as possible. Deficiencies are defined as a condition that will or has the potential to adversely impact the performance of a system or portion thereof. Deficiencies should be corrected as soon as practical considering the severity of the risk. Critical deficiencies will still allow the system to perform, but its effectiveness could be impacted. Noncritical deficiencies do not impact system performance but should be corrected in a reasonable time. (Table A.3.3.7, “Water-Based Fire Protection System Inspection and Testing Findings” of the 2014 edition of NFPA25, features a list of examples and the associated deficiency/impairment.)

 

5. Inappropriate systems for hazard

The fifth reason sprinklers fail to operate is because the system is inappropriate for hazard. Five percent of sprinkler system failures are caused by an improper design of the system, wrong type of agent or the wrong type of system for the agent. One of the most critical decisions in designing a sprinkler system is determining the occupancy classification or commodity type. This decision impacts design and installation considerations, including sprinkler discharge criteria, sprinkler spacing and water supply requirements.

Throughout the life of a building, the use and occupancy type may change. NFPA 1, Fire Code, requires the owner or occupant to evaluate the adequacy of the installed system if there are any changes in occupancy, user, process or materials.

Among all the estimated sprinkler system failures that occurred between 2007 and 2011, only 7% were because of failing equipment (i.e., damaged components). This means if the four other human-error-related causes of sprinkler failures (equipment being shut off, manual intervention defeated the equipment, lack of maintenance, equipment inappropriate for type of fire) could be eliminated, the sprinkler failure rate would drop from the estimated 9% to 0.6%. 

Addressing these issues also would improve the effectiveness of the vast majority of sprinklers that do operate.

NFPA standards, such as NFPA 13, NFPA 13D, NFPA 13R, NFPA 25, as well as NFPA 4, each contribute valuable tools that building owners, insurers, homeowners and facility managers can implement to increase sprinkler operation while adequately protecting their facilities and the most important commodity of all – the people inside them.

      Lack of Inspection

NFPA 25 has specific requirements for inspecting your fire system. Of those inspection requirements, NFPA calls for monthly, quarterly, and annual inspections to ensure that your system is running smoothly. They also require an internal inspection of sprinkler piping once every five years. The internal inspection requires professionals, like us here at Frontier Fire, to take the end of the line apart, check for sludge buildup, then flush the valves. Many people do not know when their system is up for a five year inspection or they don’t inspect their system regularly, running the risk of a malfunctioning system.  

Sprinkler Head In Need of Testing

NFPA requires that all standard response sprinkler heads must be tested every 50 years and quick response heads every 10 years. Since this requirement is semi-new, large buildings, schools, and warehouses built in the 1960s are just now requiring these inspections. The systems in these buildings are very old, meaning that they could be prone to problems, leading to defective responses.

Backflow Failure

Backflow prevention devices are often used to prevent contaminated water in a sprinkler system by reversing the flow of water. When the device fails to do this, it often leads to a failed fire sprinkler system. It is required that these systems are checked annually to ensure the quality of our drinking water. Here at Frontier Fire, we offer backflow testing that inspects all backflow preventers per the ASSE and ABBA standards. During our annual visit, we also test check valves, relief valves, buffers, air inlet, and shut off valves, ensuring that your backflow system runs properly.

Missing Spare Heads or Sprinkler Head Wrench

If you have a wet system with 299 or fewer total sprinkler heads, NFPA  requires a minimum of six spare sprinkler heads in case of emergency repairs. It is required that there are at least two of each type. Having these on deck in case of an emergency, along with a head wrench allows for there to be a higher chance that your system will run without any malfunctions.

      Painted Or Loaded Heads

In every business, dust is a common occurrence. And whenever renovations take place, paint is often introduced as well.  These different foreign substances are harmful to a commercial fire sprinkler system. A fire sprinkler head can malfunction if debris or other unnatural substances are surrounding it. Although some thorough cleaning can sometimes do the trick to allow the fire sprinkler head to work properly, the best solution for any commercial fire sprinkler system is just to replace the fire sprinkler head with a brand new. This ensures that the building is secure with a proper fire sprinkler head that won’t malfunction during a fire emergency situation.

Systems That Are Due For Five Year Inspections

Many customers do not realize when they had their commercial fire sprinklers inspected that a five-year inspection is mandatory for all commercial fire sprinkler systems. Fireline can provide customers with a thorough five-year inspection. Conducting a five year inspection is a lot more intense and in depth than a typical yearly inspection. A five-year inspection requires professionals to take the end of the line apart to check for any possible sludge buildup and flush all the valves. On dry systems, professionals will need to examine the system for any scale buildup which can occur naturally over time. But this situation can trip the line causing residual water to dry on the line. Once a system is tripped, it can further push a scale to the very end of the pipe along with rocks and possibly other debris.

Head Testing

Frequently overlooked, sprinkler heads are a crucial component to any commercial fire sprinkler system. According to the NFPA requirements, standard response heads should be tested every fifty (50) years, and quick response heads every ten (10) years. Commercial facilities such as offices and schools need to ensure that every single sprinkler head is working properly to guarantee the safety of all occupants.

     2. Improper storage in the fire pump and riser rooms

Fire pump and riser rooms are dedicated spaces for fire protection equipment. Storage of non-fire-protection equipment such as file cabinets, shelving, buckets, and cleaning supplies is not permitted under codes and standards. These extra items not only clutter the room, they often prohibit or slow down accessing valves during an emergency. When fire protection equipment such as a fire pump is in operation, the room must be occupied by emergency personnel that need the space to work.
From the 2018 Edition of International Fire Code (IFC)

509.2 Equipment access. Approved access shall be provided and maintained for all fire protection equipment to permit immediate safe operation and maintenance of such equipment. Storage, trash and other materials or objects shall not be placed or kept in such a manner that would prevent such equipment from being readily accessible.

901.4.6 Pump and riser room size. Where provided, fire pump rooms and automatic sprinkler system riser rooms shall be designed with adequate space for all equipment necessary for the installation, as defined by the manufacturer, with sufficient working space around the stationary equipment. Clearances around equipment to elements of permanent construction, including other installed equipment and appliances, shall be sufficient to allow inspection, service, repair or replacement without removing such elements of permanent construction or disabling the function of a required fire-resistance-rated assembly. Fire pump and automatic sprinkler system riser rooms shall be provided with doors and unobstructed passageways large enough to allow removal of the largest piece of equipment.

3. An incorrect fire sprinkler system

Existing fire sprinkler systems were designed for the hazard or specific storage commodity of the building at the time of construction. When structures are sold and the use of them changes or the type of product (commodity) stored changes, the fire sprinkler system often needs to be updated to accommodate the new hazard.
Real estate sales of existing buildings are not regulated by fire codes and building owners who update their processes or change storage commodities often fail to update their fire protection system. As a result, local code enforcers often are the ones who wind up advising an unsuspecting owner of the necessary upgrades.
“Proper knowledge of NFPA 13 [which covers installation] is as essential as NFPA 25 [which governs inspection] for anyone responsible for these systems,” said Rick Boisvert, Fire Marshal of the Brighton (MI) Area Fire Authority.
That said, NFPA 25 does advise owners that they need to make these changes in Section 4.1.6.
From the 2018 Edition of International Fire Code (IFC)

901.4 Installation. Fire protection systems shall be maintained in accordance with the original installation standards for that system. Required systems shall be extended, altered or augmented as necessary to maintain and continue protection where the building is altered, remodeled or added to. Alterations to fire protection systems shall be done in accordance with applicable standards.

From the 2017 Edition of NFPA 25

4.1.6* Changes in Occupancy, Use, Process, or Materials. The property owner or designated representative shall not make changes in the occupancy, the use or process, or the materials used or stored in the building without evaluation of the fire protection system(s) for its capability to protect the new occupancy, use, or materials.

Do Not Hang from Sprinklers Sticker
Need to issue a warning? QRFS can help with that.

4. Hanging items from fire sprinklers and piping

You may have noticed a sticker below the sprinklers in a hotel room that prohibits hanging any item. This stems from hotel occupants using the sprinkler as a convenient hanger for clothing, especially things like long coats and wedding dresses. Many a bride-to-be or business professional has accidentally activated sprinklers, causing large messes, ruined days, and big expenses.
Specific rules prohibit hanging or supporting anything on exposed sprinkler piping such as signs not related to the sprinkler system, lighting, and even wiring. Lightweight items may seem insignificant but they are simply not a part of the fire protection system – and may cause surprising issues due to chemical incompatibility with plastic piping, electrical shorts, or spurring vibration in the system.
From the 2017 edition of NFPA 25

5.2.2.2 Sprinkler piping shall not be subjected to external loads by materials either resting on the pipe or hung from the pipe.

From the 2016 edition of NPFA 13

9.1.1.8.1* Sprinkler piping or hangers shall not be used to support non-system components.

5. Insufficient fire sprinkler clearance

Fire sprinklers throw water from six to ten feet on all sides when they deploy. In order to develop this spray and pattern, the first 18 inches from a pendent or upright sprinkler need to remain clear. And in certain storage occupancies, the first 36 inches are critical for spray and pattern development. The fire code (NFPA 1 and IFC) and fire sprinkler installation standard (NFPA 13) require these clearances to be maintained at all times. Nevertheless, fire inspectors often find storage rooms and high-piled storage areas where personnel have stacked materials within 18 or 36 inches.
From the 2018 Edition of International Fire Code (IFC)

315.3.1 Ceiling clearance. Storage shall be maintained 2 feet (610 mm) or more below the ceiling in nonsprinklered areas of buildings or not less than 18 inches (457 mm) below sprinkler head deflectors in sprinklered areas of buildings.

Exceptions

1. The 2-foot (610 mm) ceiling clearance is not required for storage along walls in nonsprinklered areas of buildings.

2. The 18-inch (457 mm) ceiling clearance is not required for storage along walls in areas of buildings equipped with an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1, 903.3.1.2 or 903.3.1.3

      1. Is my fire sprinkler or standpipe gauge too old?

If any gauge on your fire sprinkler or standpipe system is 5 years-old or older and hasn’t had a recent calibration test, it is too old! Out-of-date gauges are the most cited compliance issue during a fire system inspection. Fortunately, it’s very easy to spot old pressure gauges: the date is stamped on the face, as shown in the above image. While recalibration is an option, replacing an old gauge is the easiest and often least expensive solution. Go look at yours, we’ll wait. If any gauges are older than 5 years, replace them.
Pressure gauges are common components in fire protection systems. They are found on fire pumps, backflow preventers, pressure-reducing valves, and all types of fire sprinkler systems (wet, dry, preaction, and deluge). Gauges are installed to indicate the air or water pressure within the system or the pressures provided to the system from an air or water supply. Most pressure gauges are mechanical, meaning they have interior springs that are subject to deterioration, loss of tension, corrosion and physical damage. This explains why NFPA requires replacement or re-calibration every five years:
From the 2017 Edition of NFPA 25

13.2.7.2* Gauges shall be replaced every 5 years or tested every 5 years by comparison with a calibrated gauge.

13.2.7.3 Gauges not accurate to within 3 percent of the full scale shall be recalibrated or replaced.

While a gauge is not a critical component for a fire sprinkler or standpipe system to operate, it is a visual indicator needed for annual flow tests, main drain tests, and other weekly, monthly, and annual inspection requirements in NFPA 25. Accuracy is key. One way to ensure gauge calibration is through NIST certification, which you can learn more about here.
If it’s time for replacement, check out QRFS’ selection of in-stock pressure gauges and make sure your system is compliant.





2. Are my fire sprinkler or standpipe pipes obstructed?

Build-up caused by corrosion or the accumulation of any sediment can block and compromise a fire sprinkler or standpipe system. As a preventative measure, NFPA 25 requires an internal pipe inspection every five years to look at the condition of the pipe, assess the water quality, and find any obstructions from organic (slime, tubercles) or inorganic material (pipe coupons, rocks, etc.).
The interior condition of a fire protection piping system can vary widely due to the type of pipe or water quality. Corrosion is a big concern for any water-filled pipe (especially metal ones), and in the case of a dry-pipe or preaction system, the thin layer of water present from previous testing or condensation often accelerates this corrosion as it mixes with oxygen. This is one of the reasons many designers use nitrogen instead of air as the pressurized gas in these systems, as less oxygen means less corrosion.
NFPA 25 requires additional testing and investigation if organic or inorganic materials are found:
From the 2017 Edition of NFPA 25

14.2.1.1 An assessment of the internal condition of piping shall be conducted at a minimum of every 5 years or in accordance with 14.2.1.2 for the purpose of inspecting for the presence of foreign organic and inorganic material.

14.2.1.3 Tubercules or slime, if found, shall be tested for indications of microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC).

14.2.1.4* If the presence of sufficient foreign organic or inorganic material is found to obstruct pipe or sprinklers, an obstruction investigation shall be conducted as described in Section 14.3.

14.3.1* An obstruction investigation shall be conducted for system or yard main piping wherever any of the following conditions exist:

(1) Defective intake for fire pumps taking suction from open bodies of water

(2) The discharge of obstructive material during routine water tests

(3) Foreign materials in fire pumps, in dry pipe valves, or in check valves

(4) Foreign material in water during drain tests or plugging of inspector’s test connection(s)

(5) Unknown materials are heard in the system piping during draining, refilling, or otherwise flowing water through the system

(6) Plugged sprinklers

(7) The presence of sufficient foreign organic or inorganic material is found in the pipe

(8) Failure to flush yard piping or surrounding public mains following new installations or repairs

(9) A record of broken public mains in the vicinity

(10) Abnormally frequent false tripping of a dry pipe valve(s)

(11) A system that is returned to service after an extended shutdown (greater than 1 year)

(12) There is reason to believe that the sprinkler system contains sodium silicate or highly corrosive fluxes in copper systems

(13) A system has been supplied with raw water via the fire department connection

(14) Pinhole leaks

(15) A 50 percent increase in the time it takes water to travel to the inspector’s test connection from the time the valve trips during a full flow trip test of a dry pipe sprinkler system when compared to the original system acceptance test

When one of the above fifteen items is found, an obstruction investigation is required. This means the piping system is examined in at least four locations:
System valve
Riser
Cross main
Branch line
Instead of breaking down piping to do the obstruction investigation, NFPA 25 allows non-destructive testing. This is typically done by using a video scope camera inserted through an opening, such as a removed sprinkler. The course of action after finding an obstruction is to clean out the material, repair any damage, and flush the system. Corrosion treatment may be recommended by a contractor to prevent or delay this repeated system maintenance.






3. Are the fire pump packing glands overtightened?

It’s human nature to fix any water leak, but some leakage from fire pumps is normal – and you can harm the pump if you attempt to “fix” it by tightening the packing gland. “During normal operation of the fire pump the excess water will drip from the pump. The amount of leakage is controlled by the packing gland,” explains the Minnesota State Fire Marshal. “The packing gland, which is adjustable, should not be over-tightened. Adjusted too tight, the packing dries out, heats up and usually causes a scored shaft.”
What is considered normal leakage? According to Jack Coffelt, the National Operations Manager of Siemens, “About 60 drops per minute allows the shaft to be lubricated and cooled.” And every fire pump has a means to drain water due to this routine shaft leakage.






4. Does my sprinkler system have a fire sprinkler head wrench?

NFPA 25 requires that every building with a fire sprinkler system has a cabinet which houses various spare fire sprinkler heads and, for each type of sprinkler installed, a fire sprinkler wrench. The reason is common sense: Personnel must quickly get the system back in service to keep the building protected, and the last thing they need to do is hunt for the right fire sprinkler wrench. If you would like to avoid a citation during your next system inspection, make sure you have sprinkler wrenches at the ready! Not there? Find a replacement here.
So why do you need sprinkler wrenches, anyway? After a sprinkler activates, a facility manager or contractor needs to install a new sprinkler head. If you’re compliant, a stock of the right spare sprinklers and the specific wrenches they need are readily available in the onsite sprinkler head cabinet. Sprinkler wrenches have special designs and there is usually only one useful wrench for each specific sprinkler type.
From the 2017 Edition of NFPA 25

5.4.1.5.5* One sprinkler wrench as specified by the sprinkler manufacturer shall be provided in the cabinet for each type of sprinkler installed to be used for the removal and installation of sprinklers in the system.






5. Is my fire protection system missing required signs?

In addition to needing a general information sign that includes up to 18 pieces of information about the system, a fire safety system needs to have a hydraulic design information sign that reveals how the system works, signage for any fire department connection and signaling system, an antifreeze information sign if antifreeze is used, and signs indicating all control, drain, venting, and test connection valves. Are you missing any? Buy new signs and get back into compliance.
Signs don’t affect system performance, but they do identify critical components and provide crucial information about the system that’s needed for tests and maintenance, plus to ensure proper operation. New building owners, contractors, and responding firefighters may not intuitively know every portion of the system – signs quickly get them to the right place and give them the information they need. For example, control valves must always stay open for a sprinkler system to work in an emergency. A control valve may be shut during testing or maintenance and neglected to be reopened, causing failure down the road. Signs marking these valves help ensure that all of them are checked prior to putting a system back in operation.
Signs are required by every fire protection standard for new systems, including NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems and NFPA 14: Standard for the Installation of Standpipe and Hose Systems. NFPA 25 outlines the inspection requirements that make sure these signs are in place.





6. Has my Fire Department Connection had a hydrostatic test within the last 5 years?

NFPA 25 requires 5-year hydrostatic testing of the “piping from the fire department connection to the fire department check valve” in standpipe systems, while issuing specific requirements for hydrostatic testing of certain types of standpipe systems. Specifically, all of the piping in semiautomatic dry and manual wet and dry standpipe systems must be tested every five years. The exception to this directive is any manual wet system that is combined with a sprinkler system. Sprinklers must also be hydrostatically tested “whenever a component in a sprinkler system is adjusted, repaired, reconditioned, or replaced,” if the revision in the “pipe and fittings [affect] more than 20 sprinklers” or if “more than 20 sprinklers” are changed (NFPA 25: 5.5.1). If your standpipe or sprinkler system is out of compliance, get it tested! And if you are an ITM contractor and need a hydrostatic test pump, buy one here.
It’s important to remember the purpose of the fire department connection (FDC) in standpipe and sprinkler systems. Firefighters connect to the FDC to provide basic pressure or supplemental pressure to the interior hose connections and/or sprinklers. This is crucial in manual (wet and dry) standpipe systems, especially those in multi-story buildings; without this supply, none of the interior hoses will have pressurized water. Hydrostatic testing makes sure that the piping – that connecting the fire department connection to the standpipe system and/or the pipe in the entire system – can withstand the pressure applied by the fire engine.
Here’s the relevant section:
From the 2017 Edition of NFPA 25

6.3.2.1* Hydrostatic tests of not less than 200 psi (13.8 bar) pressure for 2 hours, or at 50 psi (3.4 bar) in excess of the maximum pressure, where maximum pressure is in excess of 150 psi (10.3 bar), shall be conducted every 5 years on manual standpipe systems and semiautomatic dry standpipe systems, including piping in the fire department connection.

6.3.2.1.1 Manual wet standpipes that are part of a combined sprinkler/standpipe system shall not be required to be tested in accordance with 6.3.2.1.

6.3.2.2 The hydrostatic test pressure shall be measured at the low elevation point of the individual system or zone being tested.

6.3.2.2.1 The inside standpipe piping shall show no leakage.

13.8.5 The piping from the fire department connection to the fire department check valve shall be hydrostatically tested at 150 psi (10 bar) for 2 hours at least once every 5 years.

5.5.1 Whenever a component in a sprinkler system is adjusted, repaired, reconditioned, or replaced, the actions required in Table 5.5.1 shall be performed.







7. Do I have enough spare fire sprinklers in the cabinet?

Just as every building with a fire sprinkler system must have a wrench that’s specific to certain sprinklers (see #4 on this list), NFPA 25 also demands an adequate supply of replacement sprinklers that match all of the existing heads within the building. The reason is simple: a damaged sprinkler means a gap in protection, and the aftermath of an activated sprinkler essentially takes the system offline. The faster the sprinkler is replaced, the faster fire protection and business can resume. Don’t simply assume you have the cabinet, spare sprinklers, and wrench – double-check today.

Did you know that the local fire marshal can make a building owner pay for a fire watch until the building’s sprinkler system is back in service? Avoid this hassle by ensuring that you have spare fire sprinkler heads ready to go. The number you need varies based on the size of the system:
From the 2016 Edition of NFPA 13

6.2.9.5 The stock of spare sprinklers shall include all types and ratings installed and shall be as follows:

(1) For protected facilities having under 300 sprinklers – no fewer than six sprinklers
(2) For protected facilities having 300 to 1000 sprinklers – no fewer than 12 sprinklers
(3) For protected facilities having over 1000 sprinklers – no fewer than 24 sprinklers







8. Are any tamper or waterflow switches missing covers?

According to Coffelt, waterflow and tamper switch covers are notoriously found missing during inspections. Sometimes a previous inspector removed the cover to adjust the tamper switch during testing or perhaps the technician never tightened the screws and vibration loosened it. The cover is needed to protect the electrical and mechanical elements of the device. If the cover is available and the switch is not damaged, put it back into place. If the switch or cover are damaged, buy a new tamper switch or flow switch.
From the 2017 Edition of NFPA 25

5.2.4 Waterflow Alarm and Supervisory Signal Initiating Device. Waterflow alarm and supervisory signal initiating devices shall be inspected quarterly to verify that they are free of physical damage.









9. Are any of my fire sprinkler heads painted or loaded?

“Loaded” sprinkler heads can be likened to a “loaded” baked potato: everything is on it. Loaded could mean the sprinkler head has paint (site applied), drywall compound, caulk, adhesive, or, most-commonly, excessive dust and dirt. If this is the case, a sprinkler head and its components (such as a cover plate) must be replaced in all cases save one: a sprinkler that is light-to-moderately loaded with dust can be cleaned if the head is not touched or damaged. If you need replacement sprinkler heads, buy them here. If you have to clean a sprinkler loaded with dirt and dust, a SprinklerVac provides a safe, touch-free way to do it.
Nearly every code (IFC, NFPA 1, IECC) and standard (NFPA 13 and NFPA 25) has language that prohibits a painted or otherwise loaded sprinkler. Why? Paint, dust, or other materials can coat the link or bulb and delay operation. In addition, paint can seal the cap that covers the orifice opening to the body of the sprinkler, limiting or preventing activation. Paint or caulk, as shown below, can also prevent a cover plate from dropping off to expose the sprinkler.

From the 2017 Edition of NFPA 25

5.2.1.1.1* Any sprinkler that shows signs of any of the following shall be replaced:

(1) Leakage
(2) Corrosion detrimental to sprinkler performance
(3) Physical damage
(4) Loss of fluid in the glass bulb heat-responsive element
(5) Loading detrimental to sprinkler performance
(6) Paint other than that applied by the sprinkler manufacturer

5.4.1.6* Sprinklers shall not be altered in any respect or have any type of ornamentation, paint, or coatings applied after shipment from the place of manufacture.








10. Does my system have a legible, complete hydraulic calculation sign?

Hydraulic information signs, sometimes referred to as “calc plates,” are important for the maintenance of the system. Often, a building owner has lost the original plans, acceptance tests, and design documents, and this sign lists much of this vital information. NFPA 25 requires missing calc plates to be replaced. Even when they are present, the information is sometimes incomplete or impossible to read. If your sign is illegible, make it readable. If it’s missing info, consult the original document or installation contractor and fill it in. And if it’s not there at all, buy a new one.
Section 25.5.1 of NFPA 13’s sprinkler system acceptance requirements specifies that all hydraulically designed sprinkler systems must have “a permanently marked weather-proof metal or rigid plastic sign secured with corrosion-resistant wire, chain, or other approved means. Such signs shall be placed at the alarm valve, dry pipe valve, preaction valve, or deluge valve supplying the corresponding hydraulically designed area.”
From the 2016 Edition of NFPA 13

1.5.2 The sign shall include the following information:

(1) Location of the design area or areas
(2) Discharge densities over the design area or areas
(3) Required flow and residual pressure demand at the base of the riser
(4) Occupancy classification or commodity classification and maximum permitted storage height and configuration
(5) Hose stream allowance included in addition to the sprinkler demand
(6) The name of the installing contractor

From the 2017 Edition of NFPA 25

5.2.5* Hydraulic Design Information Sign. The hydraulic design information sign shall be inspected annually to verify that it is provided, attached securely to the sprinkler riser, and is legible.

5.2.5.1 A hydraulic design information sign that is missing or illegible shall be replaced.
