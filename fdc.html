    The fire department connection (FDC) is an essential component of manual wet and manual dry systems, which will not work without firefighters supplying water and pressure to the system. That said, they are still required in all Class I and Class III systems, even those with onsite fire pumps that serve the express purpose of supplying pressurized water. The rationale for requiring FDCs in these systems is simple: If a fire pump malfunctions during an emergency, the FDC provides a back-up.
    
    In order to ensure adequate pressure to all portions of a building – especially in very tall structures – many standpipe systems are segmented into separate vertical zones. Each of these zones requires at least one FDC (NFPA 14: 7.12.2.1), though NFPA also stipulates that “high-rise buildings shall have at least two remotely located fire department connections for each zone.” (7.12.2) The upper floors in extremely tall buildings are an exception to this rule if a fire truck accessing an FDC cannot supply adequate water and pressure to the elevation (7.12.1.1). NFPA requires that these high floors have “an auxiliary means of supply in the form of high-level water storage with additional pumping equipment or other means acceptable to the AHJ (authority having jurisdiction).” (7.9.3)
The pumping ability of fire department vehicles varies, so a standpipe must be designed with the capabilities of local firefighters in mind. Generally speaking, most fire departments can supply enough water and pressure through the FDC to reach floors that are between 200 to 350 feet above the street.
Each FDC must also have enough individual 2.5” inlet connections to meet the flow demand of the building: one for every 250 gallons per minute (gpm) of demand. Most buildings with more than one stairwell require an FDC with at least three inlet connections (four are commonly used), and these connections must match the size and specific hose connections that are employed by the local fire department, whether they are 2.5” connections with traditional threads or 4” or 5” inlets using Storz connections (aka large diameter threadless couplings). Storz connections were once rare in the US, but they are becoming more popular, as they make it easier to connect a hose. Also, note that San Francisco and New York commonly use a 3” traditional threaded connection, so make sure that your FDC inlets match the needs of your local fire department.
FDCs can be:
Flush against the side of a building
Exposed: The heads protrude outward from the side of the building at opposite angles (this design is known as a “Siamese connection”)
Freestanding: A pipe juts upward from the ground and the inlet connections sit at the top of the pipe.
Accessibility and visibility determine which FDC design should be used.
From the 2016 Edition of NFPA 14
6.4.5.1 Fire department connections shall be visible and recognizable from the street or nearest point of fire department apparatus accessibility or on the street side of buildings.
 
6.4.5.1.1 Fire department connections shall be located and arranged so that hose lines can be attached to the inlets without interference from nearby objects, including buildings, fences, posts, landscaping, vehicles, or other fire department connections.
For example, a flush FDC on the side of a building that is blocked by shrubs will be neither visible nor accessible, whereas a freestanding version set forward from the building would work. A connection that is walled off from the street by a fence or one that is blocked by a parked car also might limit access by fire trucks. In addition, the placement and design of an FDC should take into account the path along which any attached hose will run; this path should not block any exits, potentially impeding occupants who are trying to escape from a fire.
FDC without Covers - See the junk? 
See the junk inside? Protect against that with break caps or plugs
Finally, each FDC must be clearly labeled with signage and each inlet connection must have plugs or break caps that protect the opening from any obstruction, such as vandalism or debris that could find its way inside the inlet and block the flow of water. Failing to have these caps installed is one of the most commonly cited code violations. Sometimes they break or contractors fail to install them in the first place, but thievery is a likelier cause. There are plastic or aluminum caps that firefighters can easily break open in an emergency, and screwable copper, plastic, or aluminum caps that are secured by a chain. Copper caps are more durable, but thieves may target them because of their value. Be sure to consider the risk of caps being stolen when choosing a solution that works for your building. If a thief takes them, you could be out the cost of a new cap and the possible fine associated with a code violation.
Important note for FDCs in New York and San Francisco:
 
Fire departments in New York and San Francisco are the only authorities that commonly use 3” hose connections; thus, FDC inlets in these cities and the plugs that cover them must be compatible with the local fire department. In addition, as of 2010, FDC caps or the entire apparatus must be color-coded in New York. Inlets that access a standpipe system must be red, those that access a sprinkler system must be green, and those that connect to a combined standpipe/sprinkler system are yellow. The colors enable firefighters to quickly identify the nature of an FDC in the event of an emergency.
Don't worry, we love NY and San Fran, too, which is why you can buy 3" plugs on QRFS either painted or unpainted!
Most FDCs require quarterly inspection with an annual interior inspection – if caps remain in place. The corrective measure for any issue is to repair or replace “as necessary in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions” and to essentially remove any obstructions that would keep the FDC from doing its job.
From the 2017 Edition of NFPA 25
13.8.1 Fire department connections shall be inspected quarterly to verify the following:
 
(1) Fire department connections are visible and accessible.
(2) Couplings or swivels are not damaged and rotate smoothly.
(3) Plugs or caps are in place and undamaged.
(4) Gaskets are in place.
(5) Identification signs are in place.
(6) Check valve is not leaking.
(7) Automatic drain valve is in place and operating properly.
(8) Fire department connection clapper(s) is in place and operating properly. (9) * Interior of the connection is inspected for obstructions. (10) Visible piping supplying the fire department connection is undamaged.
 
13.8.2 Interior inspections shall be conducted annually if approved locking caps or locking plugs are installed.

    Different parts of a fire department connection play a role in getting water to fire sprinkler or standpipe systems

Fire department connections (FDCs) ensure that certain fire sprinkler and standpipe systems can quickly get the water they need in an emergency. While some systems only need the FDC as a last resort, others require an external supply of water. Manual dry standpipe systems, for example, rely entirely on water pumped through an FDC for the water firefighters need.
In this article, we'll look at the role of a fire department connection in fire protection, and explain how different parts of a fire department connection – from swivels to signs –make the FDC's work possible.

What are the parts of a fire department connection?

Most discussions of fire department connections focus on the inlet body, which contains all of the parts needed to connect a fire hose to pipes supplying a fire sprinkler or standpipe system. However, a complete and NFPA-compliant fire department connection features three parts, two of which are placed out of view:
The piping to the sprinkler system riser or main
A check valve, which prevents water from flowing in the wrong direction
The inlet body
The inlet body of a fire department connection consists of these parts:
Swivels, which connect fire hose to the FDC's inlets
The inlets, which facilitate water's entry into the FDC body
An outlet connecting the body to system piping
The body, which connects these components
Fire department connection components vary slightly across models. Some include clappers to direct the flow of water through the FDC and prevent water from exiting through open inlets. Fire department connections for Storz couplings may feature only the inlet and the outlet, providing a considerably more compact way to deliver a supply of water.
Most FDCs have a four-inch (4") or six-inch (6") outlet that connects to the building’s internal piping. That piping has either threaded ends – typically threaded with National Pipe Thread (NPT) – or grooved ends. Some have ends that are compatible with non-threaded Storz connections.
Open inlets have a tendency to gather dirt, dust, debris, and garbage, clogging system piping. For that reason, NFPA-compliant fire department connections also feature breakable caps or combination plug and chain assemblies that protect the FDC's inlets while the system is not in use.
What types of fire department connection are used today?

Three kinds of FDCs serve today's fire protection systems: exposed, freestanding, and flush.

Exposed FDCs are found on the outside wall of a building. The body, inlets, and swivels remain exposed for easy access by firefighters.

This exposed two-way FDC has no caps, allowing debris to accumulate in the inlets.


Freestanding connections act as exposed FDCs but stand apart from the building being supplied. Freestanding FDCs connect to the building’s system through a buried pipe, creating a convenient point of access for firefighters.

Flush connections install flush to the building’s wall, leaving only the inlet couplings or swivels exposed. The body and outlets sit behind the wall, fully concealed by an identification plate. Flush FDCs are considered more aesthetically appealing, especially when the building requires three or more inlets.

Proper placement of fire department connections promotes immediate access for firefighters

An inaccessible or hard-to-find FDC can paralyze a fire sprinkler or standpipe system. As such, an FDC's location should always maximize accessibility for firefighters.
While local fire codes and the preferences of fire authorities govern the exact placement of an FDC, it should be positioned on the street side of the building and be easily recognizable. Each fire department connection should be positioned reasonably close to the nearest hydrant – 100 feet at most – but not so close that fire trucks or fire pumps placed near the hydrant lack clearance. Further, the engine and its hoses should not obstruct access to the building once connected to the FDC. Such obstructions can make it more difficult for firefighters entering or exiting the structure. Poorly-placed hose can also limit the positions available to firefighters who fight fires with aerial ladders.
Required signage identifies the system served by a fire department connection

NFPA-compliant FDCs require minimum signage that denotes the system they serve such as “Automatic Sprinklers,” “Standpipes,” “Standpipe & Auto-Sprinkler,” or “Test Connection.” Most manufacturers provide rings to clearly label these connections.
<img src="https://www.qrfs.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/brass-combination-fdc-plate-600.jpeg" />
The lettering on this identification plate indicates that an FDC serves a combination fire sprinkler and standpipe system.




These signs help first responders quickly locate the connection they need and know what they are connecting to. In addition, FDCs often feature signs that list the specific part or parts of the building that the fire sprinkler or standpipe system supplies.
Compatibility between the fire department's hose connections and a building's FDC couplings is paramount

The swivels on an FDC should always fit local fire hose couplings. Mismatched hose threads can delay firefighting efforts or render firefighters totally unable to supply water to a building's fire protection system.
One of the most common FDCs, known as a Siamese or two-way connection, has two 2 1/2-inch female swivel connections. NFPA requires that all fire department connections use 2 1/2" National Hose (NH) threaded female couplings unless the authority having jurisdiction designates another specific connection type.
<img src="https://www.qrfs.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/siamese-fdc-600.jpeg" />

The use of these female swivels distinguishes many FDCs from other connections, including roof manifolds and fire pump test connections, which feature male-threaded inlets.
Clappers guide water through fire department connections

Pressurized water moving through fire department connections can close built-in clappers. These clappers prevent water from exiting through open inlets. On an FDC with two or more inlets, clappers allow firefighters to add or remove hoses as needed. If the flow of water to one hose stops (or a hose bursts) a clapper will close to prevent backflow. In the meantime, other hoses can continue to supply water through the other inlets.
Standard two-way FDCs may include either one or two clappers. The clapper on a single-clapper model swings freely between both inlets. Water pressure from one inlet causes the clapper to block the unused inlet. When two hoses are used, the clapper takes a position between the two inlets, permitting the passage of water through both inlets. These models use less material and are generally more affordable.

Viewed through the outlet of a single-clapper FDC: a lone clapper rests between the two inlets, ready to swing closed as needed.

Double-clapper two-way fire department connections have one clapper for each inlet. While they are more expensive, double-clapper models offer added durability and an additional safeguard against bursting hose lines.
Water-based fire protection systems depend on fire department connections

Fire sprinkler systems rely on fire department connections for a supply of water when other sources are exhausted or unavailable. FDCs are also a key component for charging many standpipe systems. These systems are designed to provide water to servicing hoses in strategically placed locations inside a building or structure.
Standpipe systems are most common in large buildings, where areas of the facility are too far from an outside entrance, and multistory buildings, where they eliminate the need for running long lengths of hose in stairwells and on the ground. Manual wet standpipe systems require external charging from outside sources of water and thus rely on the fire department connection for both their water and their water pressure. In both cases, the FDC located at the ground level is the liaison between built-in piping and an external supply of water.
How to choose a fire department connection for your building

Before replacing an FDC, you want to check several things, including the number of female inlets, the number of clappers, and the thread type. If you’re replacing an FDC, the easiest way to do this is to purchase the same model. FDCs for NFPA-compliant systems should be selected and installed in accordance with local fire code along with NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems and NFPA 14: Standard for the Installation of Standpipe and Hose Systems.
QRFS offers durable fire department connection kits designed for use as flush or exposed FDCs. Our selection of brass and chrome-finished exposed FDCs includes two types: angled FDCs, which feature an outlet at a 90-degree vertical angle to the inlets, and straight FDCs, which place inlets and outlets at the same vertical angle. All of our angled exposed FDCs are perfect for use as freestanding fire department connections when coupled with a metal freestanding sleeve.
